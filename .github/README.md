# collectd-haproxy-plugin

[![pipeline status](https://github.com/immobiliare/collectd-haproxy-plugin/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/immobiliare/collectd-haproxy-plugin/actions/workflows)

This is a [collectd](https://collectd.org) plugin for [HAProxy](https://haproxy.com).

It uses the exposed HAProxy socket commands (on defined TCP/Unix sockets) to monitor statistics from the `show info`, `show stat` and `show resolvers` (if on HAProxy 1.8+) commands.
This allows monitoring of the overall service status as well as frontends, backends, servers and resolvers configured.
It also supports multi-process statistics aggregation, allowing to configure multiple sockets to collect metrics from.

It's the result of the [hmrc/collectd-haproxy](https://github.com/hmrc/collectd-haproxy) repository fork, to which, mainly, the support for multi stats sockets aggregation has been added.

    Socket "unix:///var/run/haproxy/proc2.sock"
    Socket "tcp://127.0.0.1:8080"
    ProxyMonitor "backend"
    # ProxyMonitor "server" or "frontend"
    # ProxyIgnore to ignore metrics
    # Verbose to increase verbosity
  </Module>
